### Introduction

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

### Quick start installation

To install from the [Marketplace](https://octobercms.com/theme/prismify-bootstrap-starter-kit), click on the "Add to Project" button and then select the project you wish to add it to before updating the project to pull in the plugin.

To install from the backend, go to Settings -> Front-end Themes -> Find more themes and then search for Prismify.Bootstrap.

To install from [the repository](https://github.com/prismify/oc-bootstrap-theme), `git clone https://github.com/prismify/oc-bootstrap-theme.git themes/bootstrap` and then run `yarn && yarn dev` from your theme root in order to pull in the dependencies.
